        <h1>Umbonia spinosa</h1>
        <h4>Umbonia spinosa can be distinguished from other members of its genus
         by the appearance of its elongated pronotum, or dorsal horn.
         The dorsal horn is located between or just behind its humerals
         and they possess a short metopidium. The dorsal horn itself is straight
         and the base of the plate is yellow, testaceous or pale green, with red 
         or yellow vittae (stripes) at each side, though sometimes U. spinosa 
         can be characterized by black vittae. The dorsal horn gradually tapers 
         to a point from base to summit, similar to a thorn in appearance. </h4>
