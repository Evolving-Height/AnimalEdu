        <h1>The Sugar Gliders</h1>
        <h4>These pocket-sized marsupials are native to Australia,
             Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. They have become popular 
             pets in recent years, fetching prices of up to $350 online. 
             Although the IUCN has classified them as being of “least 
             concern,” the procurement of these animals by the pet trade 
             often involves great cruelty. In their investigative video 
             on this subject, PETA states that due to traumatic overcrowding 
             during the transportation process, many of these animals end 
             up being mauled or suffocated to death.</h4>
        <h1>How can we help them?</h1>
        <h4>● First off, never, ever buy an exotic animal! Discourage others from doing so too. <br>
            ● Sign Anna Nekaris’ Change.org petition calling for an end to the endangered 
            wildlife trade.<br>
            ● Look behind the hype of cute wild animal videos such as “Tickling Slow Loris.” 
            Watch “Tickling Slow Loris – The Truth” instead.<br>
            ● Make a donation to SeaHorse Hawaii or to the SeaHorse Trust.<br>
            ● Sign this online petition to help stop the illegal trade in sugar gliders.<br></h4>
