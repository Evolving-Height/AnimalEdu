        <h1>The Gerenuk</h1>
        <h4>These majestic parrots – another South American species classified 
            as “endangered” by the IUCN – have also been aggressively targeted
             by the pet trade, with the result of their total population in 
             the wild now standing at a mere 2,500 mature individuals. Other 
             threats include banana plantations, cattle-ranching, and logging,
              all of which have served to dwindle their natural deciduous 
              rainforest habitat in countries such as Costa Rica, Ecuador, 
              Colombia, and Nicaragua</h4>
