        <h1>The Harpy Eagle</h1>
        <h4>Imagine a large, forest-dwelling bird with legs almost as thick
             as your wrists. Imagine a bird able to hunt heavy sloths or 
             monkeys with nothing but the strength of its claws, toes 
             and legs. Imagine a bird that might mate for life and that
              shares all parenting duties. Imagine a bird that cares for 
              its chick for up to the first two years of its life. If you 
              can imagine a bird with all these characteristics, you can 
              imagine a Harpy Eagle.</h4>
              <h1>Did you know?</h1>
        <h4>● Harpy Eagles are among the world’s largest and most powerful eagles. 
            Their rear talons are about 3-4 inches long – the same size as a grizzly bear’s claws!<br>
            ● Like many other birds of prey, Harpy Eagles continue to bring fresh green twigs 
            and branches to the nest after the chick has hatched. Some researchers think this 
            helps keep insects and parasites away and provides a cooler environment for the 
            nestling.<br>
            ● A female can weigh up to two times more than her mate.<br>
            ● Deforestation and shooting are the two main threats to the survival of Harpy 
            Eagles.</h4>
