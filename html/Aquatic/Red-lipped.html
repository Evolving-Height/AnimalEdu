        <h1>Red-lipped Batfish</h1>
        <h4>The red-lipped batfish is an unusual fish. Closely related to other batfish but completely unique to Galapagos, the red-lipped batfish is a bottom dweller and is usually found within the sandy bottom of reefs or on the ocean floor. They can be found at depths of 3 – 76 m in the Pacific Ocean around Galapagos or around the edges of reefs up to about 120m deep.

            The body colour of the red-lipped batfish is light brown and greyish on its back, with a white stomach. On the top side, there is usually a dark brown stripe made of brown dots, starting at the head and going all the way down the back to the tail. The snout and horn of the red-lipped batfish are a brownish colour. As its name suggests, the batfish also has bright, almost fluorescent, red lips looking as though it has recently eaten a bloody meal, or is wearing some very bright lipstick. 
            
            The red-lipped batfish has another strange trait. Although it is capable of swimming along the seabed in search of food, the batfish’s fins are better adapted to work as pseudo-legs. These ‘legs’ are used to walk and perch on while it surveys its surroundings. It has a structure on its head known as an illicium which is thought to be employed for luring prey in. The species is a piscivore and insectivore, mainly feeding on other small fish and small crustaceans like shrimps and molluscs.</h4>
