        <h1>Goblin Shark</h1>
        <h4>TSwishing through the deep sea, a goblin shark notices a small, 
            yummy-looking squid. The animal inches toward its prey. But as 
            the fish closes in, the snack starts to dart away. So the shark 
            thrusts its jaw three inches out of its mouth! (The jaw is 
            connected to three-inch-long flaps of skin that can unfold 
            from its snout.) The predator then grabs the squid in its 
            teeth. After scarfing down the meal, the shark fits its jaw 
            back into its mouth and swims off.<br>
            Scientists donâ€™t know much about the behavior of these rarely 
            seen animals. But they believe that goblin sharks are solitary, 
            just like many other shark species. They also think the fish 
            are most active in the morning and evening. These animals are 
            likely sluggish creatures, which can make it hard to chase 
            food. Luckily for the slowpokes, their special extendable 
            jaws give them some extra bite.</h4>
