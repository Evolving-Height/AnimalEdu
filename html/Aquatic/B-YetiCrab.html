        <h1>The Yeti Crab</h1>
        <h4>An international team of scientists recently announced the discovery of a new 
            species of blind deep-sea crab whose legs are covered with long, pale yellow 
            hairs. This crab was first observed in March 2005 by marine biologists 
            using the research submarine Alvin to explore hydrothermal vents along the 
            Pacific-Antarctic ridge, south of Easter Island. Because of its hairy legs, 
            this animal was nicknamed the “Yeti crab,” after the fabled Yeti, the 
            abominable snowman of the Himalayas. The Yeti crab was discovered 
            during the Easter Microplate expedition to the southeast Pacific, 
            led by MBARI scientist Bob Vrijenhoek. The primary goal of this expedition was to learn how bottom-dwelling animals from one deep-sea hydrothermal vent are able to colonize other hydrothermal vents hundreds or thousands of miles away. Vrijenhoek and his team were addressing this question by comparing the DNA of animals at hydrothermal vents in different parts of the Pacific Ocean.</h4>
