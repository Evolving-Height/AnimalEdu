        <h1>Dugong</h1>
        <h4>These enormous vegetarians can be found in warm coastal waters from East 
            Africa to Australia, including the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Pacific.
            Dugongs are related to manatees and are 
            similar in appearance and behaviorâ€” though the dugong's tail is fluked like 
            a whale's. Both are related to the elephant, although the giant land animal 
            is not at all similar in appearance or behavior.
            Female dugongs have one calf after a yearlong pregnancy, and the mother helps 
            her young reach the surface and take its first breath. A young dugong remains 
            close to its mother for about 18 months, sometimes catching a ride on her broad back.
            These languid animals make an easy target for coastal hunters, and they were 
            long sought for their meat, oil, skin, bones, and teeth. Dugongs are now 
            legally protected throughout their range, but their populations are still 
            in a tenuous state. Some believe that dugongs were the inspiration 
            for ancient seafaring tales of mermaids and sirens.</h4>
