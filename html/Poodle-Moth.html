        <h1>Venezuelan Poodle Moth</h1>
        <h4>This little critter has been compared to everything from a 
            cross between "a miniature gargoyle and a Furby" to a puzzling 
            new "Pokemon character." But whatever people think of its looks, 
            the Venezuelan poodle moth is, apparently, the real deal. 
            The photo, snapped in 2009 by zoologist Arthur Anker of 
            Brazil's Federal University of Ceará, has become something 
            of an overnight sensation after Anker posted it onto his 
            Flickr page. (Take a closer look below.) He first spotted 
            the tiny insect with a 1-inch wingspan while walking through
            Canaimá National Park in Venezuela, and is now asking other 
            zoologists to help identify its genus. A few experts believe 
            the poodle moth is related to the furry muslin moth 
            (Diaphora mendica), which gives scientists hope that 
            there are still fantastical creatures out there we haven't 
            even seen yet. "Thousands of new insects are discovered every 
            year in the South American rain forests," says 
            cryptozoologist Kark Shuker. "So it would be by no means 
            unusual if [Anker's] Venezuelan poodle moth proved to be 
            one, too."</h4>
