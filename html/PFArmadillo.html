        <h1>Pink Fairy Armadillo</h1>
        <h4>Also known as the Pichiciego, the pink fairy armadillo is the 
            smallest known species of armadillo. It lives in the sandy plains
            and dry grasslands of central Argentina and other parts of South America.
            Unique adaptations like an aerodynamic body shape, smooth dorsal
            shell, and sharp claws mean this creature is able to completely
            bury itself in sand in a matter of seconds and then nagivate 
            underground with ease. Similar to a mole, the pink fairy 
            armadillo will spend the vast majority of its life underground.
            It is also nocturnal, only emerging ocassionally at night 
            to find food.</h4>
