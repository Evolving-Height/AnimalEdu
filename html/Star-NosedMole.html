        <h1>Star-Nosed Mole</h1>
        <h4>Ever wondered what seaweed smells like? Ask a star-nosed mole, the sniffer 
            extraordinaire of the animal kingdom. It has a ‘handy’ sensory organ that 
            is made up of 22 fleshy, mobile appendages surrounding the nostrils and gives 
            these sensitive fellows their name. You can sniff out Condylura cristata, 
            in the wetlands of North America where they can be found in a network of underground 
            tunnels foraging for insects, worms and molluscs. They also forage underwater, 
            blowing air bubbles out of their nostrils and inhaling them again to sniff out 
            their quarry.</h4>
            <h1>Their Nose!</h1>
            <h4>In the gloomy, underworld labyrinth of the mole, light is scarce, so,
                 like other species of mole, they have poorly developed eyes and are 
                 nearly blind. The rays of the mole’s starry nose, however, form a 
                 highly specialised, touch-sensitive organ that enables it to form a 
                 tactile map of the world, and to detect and identify prey at lightning 
                 speed. It can identify and take into its mouth up to 10 pieces of earthworm
                  in 2.3 seconds making it the world’s fastest forager! Its little nose, 
                  only 0.5 inches in diameter, holds 25,000 mechanoreceptors called 
                  Eimer’s organs, making it 6 times more sensitive than the human 
                  hand, and the most sensitive organ in the entire animal kingdom.
                   The nosey mole can explore up to 13 patches of substrate a 
                   second, neurons in the mole’s somatosensory cortex of the 
                   brain respond to touch within 12ms and it only takes a 
                   further 5ms for commands to be relayed back to the nose, 
                   it takes us sluggish humans 100ms just to blink! About 
                   half of the brain is dedicated to the sensory feedback 
                   from the nose; this represents the importance of this 
                   schtunning schnoz to the lifestyle of the mole. And on 
                   that note I’ll say….smell ya later.</h4>
