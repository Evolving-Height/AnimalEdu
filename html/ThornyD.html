        <h1>The Thorny Dragon</h1>
        <h4>A small lizard native to Australia, the thorny devil is known by various other names like thorny dragon, moloch, and mountain devil. It’s mainly active during the day and can change colors to blend into its environment. As intimidating as it looks, the thorny devil is actually a slow-moving lizard that mainly eats ants. It has a “fake head” behind its neck that works as a way to fool predators. Thorny devils sport a unique gait, which is slow and halting with their tails straight up in the air.</h4>
        <h4>● The names for the thorny devil reflect its intimidating appearance, including its scientific name Moloch, which was an ancient god depicted as a horrible beast.<br>
            ● These lizards can puff out their chests to look bigger and make themselves more difficult to eat due to all their spines.<br>
            ● The animal eats about 750 ants per day, but it’s capable of eating as many as 3,000 ants in one day.<br>
            ● Thorny devils have a strange gait where they freeze and rock in jerky movements. They may freeze midstep to throw off predators.<br>
            ● The ridged scales on the thorny devil aren’t just for protection. They also serve to channel water to the lizard’s mouth.<br> <br>
            Australia’s Great Sandy Desert interior provides the native habitat for the lizard. They can be found in sandy deserts and scrub with sandy soil. They are only found in areas with significant sandy soil. They don’t like areas with rocky or hard soil. The lizard has unique physical features that enable it to survive in the arid parts of Australia. Moisture-attracting grooves between the lizard’s scales can channel any minute amount of water to their mouths. This means that even just collected dew from overnight or on vegetation can provide water for the animal. In extreme situations, the lizard can also bury itself in the sand to draw moisture to its scales.</h4>
