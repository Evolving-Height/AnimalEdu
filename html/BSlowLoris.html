        <h1>The Slow Loris</h1>
        <h4>Slow lorises have been targeted by the exotic pet trade in recent years 
            because of their undeniable cuteness (as demonstrated in the well-known 
            YouTube video “Tickling Slow Loris”). Sadly, the procurement of these 
            animals for the trade frequently involves tearing them away from their 
            families and removing their teeth so that they do not bite their new 
            owners – not to mention the fact that for every slow loris who is 
            successfully captured and delivered to their new owners, many 
            more die in the process. In order to aid the conservation of 
            these animals, Prof. Anna Nekaris, a primatologist with Oxford 
            University in the U.K., has launched an education and advocacy 
            website called the Little Fireface Project (named after the 
            literal translation of the Sundanese term for slow loris).
