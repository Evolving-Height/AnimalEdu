        <h1>The Kinkajou</h1>
        <h4>These animals are native to Central and Southern America, with territories ranging from Mexico to Bolivia. They are currently threatened by increased deforestation and human encroachment on their territories – so surely the last thing they need is to be sought after by impulsive celebrities who have no idea how to care for them properly. However, this was the fate of Paris Hilton’s pet kinkajou Baby Luv, who famously bit her arm at a Hollywood party back in 2005 – a cry for help, perhaps?</h4>
