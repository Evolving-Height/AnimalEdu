        <h1>The Panda Ant</h1>
        <h4>There are some really cute insects out there, and one genus of especially
             cute insects is the genus Euspinolia, called the Panda Ants. Panda Ants
              are actually not ants at all, but instead are wasps of the family Mutillidae,
               commonly called the Velvet Ants. The Panda Ant was first described
                to science in 1938 and is found in dry coastal regions of Chile.
                 Like many wasp species, and unlike true ants, Panda Ants do not live
                  in colonies and also do not have queens and drones and workers. Panda
                   Ants get their name from the dramatic black and white coloration
                    of the females. However, donâ€™t get too comfortable around a Panda
                     Ant because they get their other common name of Cow Killer Ants
                      from the incredibly painful sting they can deliver from their
                       unusually long and maneuverable stinger. Only females can sting
                        since the stinger in these wasps is a modification
                         of the ovipositor. <br> 
                         These wasps have a lot of really cool and interesting
                          adaptations. One is their extreme sexual dimorphism.
                           Females have the stingers mentioned above, but they 
                           have no wings. The males are larger and while
                            they lack stingers, they have wings.
                             The differences between the sexes
                              are so dramatic that it is often very difficult to determine
                               what the two sexes of a given species are unless the two
                                are actually seen mating. The males are in many species
                                 are so much larger than the females that they actually
                                  pick the females up and carry them in flight during mating.
                                   After mating, the male sets the female down and she then
                                    crawls into the underground burrow of other bee or
                                     wasp species. The larva of these other ground-nesting
                                      bees and wasps will become the hosts for the growing
                                       Panda Ant larva. What happens is the female Panda Ant
                                        will lay a single egg beside each host larva or pupae
                                         she finds. These eggs hatch and the Panda Ant larva
                                          eats its way into the host larva. The Panda Ant grows
                                           inside of the host larva, feeding off its tissue,
                                            eventually killing it. Once the larva Panda Ant
                                             matures into an adult it only feeds on nectar.

                         Another cool adaptation is the incredibly strong exoskeletons of these wasps, so strong that entomologists often have difficulty getting a steel pin through collected specimens! This hard and strong exoskeleton helps reduce water loss, which is useful because these wasps live in dry and sandy regions of Chile where water retention is a major concern. Their hard exoskeletons also allow them to invade the underground nests of their host species.

                         Very little is known about the status and population levels of these wasps. Due to their limited geographic range and the restricted nature of western side of the Andes Mountains, they will probably be strongly effected by climate change as the dry conditions that exist within the temperature ranges these insects seem to favor are pushed uphill.</h4>
